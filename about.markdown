# About Me

My name is Eric Reid. I am a senior at Brigham Young University majoring in statistics with an emphasis in applied statistics and analytics. I also am minoring in communications. After graduation, I will begin a job with the Berkeley Research Group in their healthcare analytics department with their office in Chicago, IL. I understand that we live in a world that can be unlocked through the use and understanding of data, so I see the vital importance to develop greater familiarity with these topics as I enter into the workforce and beyong during the upcoming decades.

I grew up in a suburb of Chicago called Naperville. I am an avid sports fan with allegiances to the local Chicago teams. I consider myself a huge fan of movies and history. I spend a lot of my days consuming content related to those two topics.
