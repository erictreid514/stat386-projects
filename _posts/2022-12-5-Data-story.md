### Summary of Project
I am a huge baseball fan. I love the history of the sport, and even though I find playoff baseball excruciating as I sit on pins and needles during every at-bats while watching my Chicago Cubs, I cannot look away. A wonderful meeting point between my interests is the relationship between statistics and baseball. Made famous by the book and movie, Moneyball, the use of analytics in baseball has taken over the sports as games are played theoretically on spreadsheets and models before the pitchers take the rubber and batters step-up to the plate. When asked to perform analyses on data, my mind immediately went to the topic of baseball.

Throughout this semester, I narrowed my focus on the sport to analyzing pitching performances based on one metric: Earned Run Average or ERA. I created a blog that shows how I collected the data from the 500 best pitching seasons in Major League Baseball history. Then a subsequent blog shows an exploratory data analysis that I performed looking for general trends in the data, possibly highlighting future research questions that need to be analyzed to better understand success and performance. This blog serves as a temporary conclusion to this study as I attempt to convey a story through the data that I have collected and analyzed. You can find all the work that I have done already by accessing [my repository](https://github.com/erictreid514). If you have any questions or advice for further analysis, please leave a comment!

### Data Story
In the history of Major League Baseball, certain seasons stand out for unique performances or results. A notable season is the 1998 season which saw more home runs hit than in any other season including two players, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, breaking the record for the most home runs hit in a single season. 1968 was one of those notable seasons, but it was not notable for explosive home runs, rather, it has been titled the year of the pitcher. 1968 saw many pitchers produce career performances as Hall of Fame players like Bob Gibson and Denny McLain. More information on this season can be seen [here](https://jugssports.com/blog/1968-will-always-be-remembered-as-the-year-of-the-pitcher/). Even though remarkable pitching is impressive, it leads to boring, low-scoring games. Because of this, Major League Baseball stepped in with some significant changes during the off-season to create less of an advantage for the pitcher. This included changes like shrinking the strike zone, but the most notable was the lowering of the pitching moundfrom 15 inches to 10 inches. This data story looks to examine what the effects of this change have been in the half century since these changes were implemented. Are pitchers less dominant due to these changes than they were prior to the changes made in 1969? Take a look at this graphic and tell me what you think!
