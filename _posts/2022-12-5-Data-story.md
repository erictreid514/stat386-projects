### Data Story
In the history of Major League Baseball, certain seasons stand out for unique performances or results. A notable season is the 1998 season which saw more home runs hit than in any other season including two players, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, breaking the record for the most home runs hit in a single season. 1968 was one of those notable seasons, but it was not notable for explosive home runs, rather, it has been titled the year of the pitcher. 1968 saw many pitchers produce career performances as Hall of Fame players like Bob Gibson and Denny McLain. More information on this season can be seen [here](https://jugssports.com/blog/1968-will-always-be-remembered-as-the-year-of-the-pitcher/). Even though remarkable pitching is impressive, it leads to boring, low-scoring games. Because of this, Major League Baseball stepped in with some significant changes during the off-season to create less of an advantage for the pitcher. This included changes like shrinking the strike zone, but the most notable was the lowering of the pitching moundfrom 15 inches to 10 inches. This data story looks to examine what the effects of this change have been in the half century since these changes were implemented. Are pitchers less dominant due to these changes than they were prior to the changes made in 1969? Take a look at this graphic and tell me what you think!
