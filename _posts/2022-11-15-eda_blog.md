### Introduction
Two weeks ago, we saw the end of the 2022 World Series as the Houston Astros beat the Philadelphia Phillies in an exciting 6-game series. Integral to their success, the Astros produced a dominate pitching performance that led to key victories in the last three games of the series. Though it is a small sample size, it is evident that dominant pitching is key to winning at the highest level. In my previous [blog](https://erictreid514.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/18/webscraping-blog.html), I showed the process that I followed to scrap the data from the best 500 pithcing seasons in Major League Baseball history. I decided to narrow my focus on the pitching statistic Earned Run Average or ERA, which is defined [here](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/earned-run-average). This blog will start to examine to data looking for possible trends that lead to better pitching performances, or at least provide valuable insights into learning what may have led to these great single-season performances.
