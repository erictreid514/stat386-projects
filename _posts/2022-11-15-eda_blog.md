### Introduction
Two weeks ago, we saw the end of the 2022 World Series as the Houston Astros beat the Philadelphia Phillies in an exciting 6-game series. Integral to their success, the Astros produced a dominate pitching performance that led to key victories in the last three games of the series. Though it is a small sample size, it is evident that dominant pitching is key to winning at the highest level. In my previous [blog](https://erictreid514.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/18/webscraping-blog.html), I showed the process that I followed to scrap the data from the best 500 pithcing seasons in Major League Baseball history. I decided to narrow my focus on the pitching statistic Earned Run Average or ERA, which is defined [here](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/earned-run-average). This blog will start to examine to data looking for possible trends that lead to better pitching performances, or at least provide valuable insights into learning what may have led to these great single-season performances. In statisitcs, this examiniation process if often referred to as an Exploratory Data Anlysis or EDA. An EDA usually consists of both summary statistics and visual representations of data to help researchers learn more about the data in order to help figure out where to take the data in further analysis.

If you download this data: [era.csv](https://github.com/erictreid514/stat386-projects/files/10023825/era.csv), you will be able to use the same data that I did to perform an EDA of your own. I performed these analyses using python with the four packages seen below.

### Finding General Summary Statistics
When performing an EDA, there are several different styles of approach. I thought it would be best to look at several general statistical summaries to get a general understanding of the data including figures like averages and medians, as well as the most common values for variables like years, ages, and players.

#### Means for Earned Run Average, Innings Pitched, and Age of Pitcher
I first used a simple mean function to get general figures of what the average ERA was for the best 500 seasons. I also looked at the average number of innings pitched and the age of the pitchers during these 500 individual seasons.

#### Medians for Earned Run Average, Innings Pitched, and Age of Pitcher
I proceded to do something very similar with the medians for ERA, IP, and the pitcher's age.

![median](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100799679/202243117-75ab0167-b26b-4c1f-b707-49cc53bcf01b.jpg)

These figures help us see that the best pitching seasons will have an ERA less than 2. Often the pitcher will be about 27 years old, and he will have pitched around 250 innings throughout the year.

#### Finding the modes of the data
I wanted to see what the most common years, ages, and players were to help showcase which players were the most dominant, or to see if there were years in MLB history with remarkable pitching performances.

##### Year

Since the year 1908 was the most common, this shows that this season had the highest number of great pitching performances.

##### Age
As you can see below, the most common age falls in line with what we discovered when we calculated the means and medians for age.

##### Player
Here we can see the five players who were on the list more than any other pitchers, and it makes sense that these 5 pitchers are considered some of the greatest pitchers in baseball history. [Walter Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Johnson) and [Christy Mathewson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_Mathewson) had dominant careers that are worth examining.

### Visual representations of the data
While there are more statistics to be analyzed, I find it easier to get an understanding of the data if I can see the data represented visually rather than through a bunch of numbers.
