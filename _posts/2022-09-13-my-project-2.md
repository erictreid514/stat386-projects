### Summary of Work

For this assignment, I practiced creating and initializing git repositories.
I also used prompts from the professor to create documents inside of the repositories. I then edited those documents and added the changes.
Some of the commands I used can be seen below:
```
git status
git init
git add .
git commit -m [text]
```

Another aspect of the assignment was to become familiar with git branches. I worked on creating new branches, while also copying data from one branch to another and deleting unnecessary branches.
Finally, as can easily be seen by this blog post, the assignment also focused on how to create blogs using the resources in git and github.
