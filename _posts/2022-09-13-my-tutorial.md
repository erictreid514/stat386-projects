### Background on Data Distributions

An essential aspect of statistics is understanding the distributions of random variables. If we know how a random variable is distributed, then we can use this information to calculate probabilities of certain events occuring based on the data that has been collected. The statistical software R has many built in packages that work effectively with random variable distributions. In this blog, I will give a couple examples of what this will look like.
